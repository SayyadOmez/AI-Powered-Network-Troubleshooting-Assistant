Cisco Router Troubleshooting:
To configure DNS on a Cisco router, use the 'ip name-server' command. To check DNS resolution, use 'ping', 'nslookup', or 'show hosts'.
If DNS is not working, check ACLs and NAT rules.

Common DNS Issues:
- Incorrect DNS IPs in /etc/resolv.conf
- DNS ports (53) blocked by firewall
- ISP DNS issues â€” try using 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1

Firewall Blocks:
- Use 'nmap' or 'telnet' to check if ports are open.
- Firewalls may block outbound ICMP or TCP ports.
- Check iptables or ufw rules if using Linux.

High Latency:
- Causes: long routing paths, overloaded links, congestion.
- Tools: traceroute, ping, MTR.
- Solutions: optimize routes, upgrade bandwidth, QoS settings.
